Hi Seeresha,

Following up on our recent discussions, I wanted to share the updated SQL scripts needed to support the TechADS DQ App and outline where things stand.

What’s included:
- Updated DDL and INSERT scripts for the local DQ tables (SLA, GVR, Null, Duplicate, Recon, API, Deviation)
  - Analyst/comment-related fields have been removed from the local DQ tables
  - Each table now generates a globally unique FAILURE_ID via triggers
- New FAILURE_COMMENTS table to centrally capture analyst comments, exclusions, Jira references, status, and audit fields
  - This table links back to each DQ table via FAILURE_ID
  - Local DQ tables remain immutable and source-driven
- New DDL scripts for EIQ DQ tables (Null, Duplicate, Reconciliation)
- Sample join queries showing how the DQ app will pull failures from each local DQ table and overlay comments from FAILURE_COMMENTS for the UI

Design clarification:
- After reviewing with the team, we confirmed that a separate “master failures” table is not needed.
- The FAILURE_ID generated in each DQ table will be the common join key used by the app.

Open item – EIQ ingestion:
- We’re still aligning with the EIQ and Change Dev teams on the best approach to ingest EIQ DQ results into TechADS (e.g., autosys-driven vs. upstream-managed loads).
- Once that’s finalized, we’ll align the insert/load logic so EIQ failures can be used in the DQ app the same way as local DQ results.

Let me know if you’d like to set up a quick review call to walk through the scripts or confirm scope before implementation. Happy to go through anything in more detail.

Thanks,  
Kamran
