Hi Sridarshan,

Thanks again for taking the time to connect today. I wanted to recap what we covered on our onboarding call and outline next steps so we’re aligned.

Topics Covered
- Overview of the TechADS DQ Controls team hub, including team responsibilities and how the work fits into Daily DQ and PARCM processes.
- Walkthrough of the Onboarding Confluence site, which outlines access requirements and instructions for getting set up across tools and platforms.
- Review of the TechADS process documentation housed on the team hub, including end-to-end process guides.
- High-level overview of the Daily DQC monitoring workflow, where you’ll:
  - Monitor each control type daily
  - Perform root cause analysis (RCA) for failures
  - Identify the owning / responsible team
  - Track remediation and resolution status
- Introductory discussion on:
  - PARCM submission process
  - Daily DQ & PARCM application
  - EIQ integrations
  - TechADS Control Metric documentation

Next Steps
- Please continue working through the access setup outlined on the onboarding Confluence page.
- I’ll schedule a KT session to go deeper into the Daily DQC monitoring workflow, tools, and RCA expectations.
- We’ll connect with Lakshmi to ensure the appropriate Jira stories are created/assigned for your work.
- We’ll also coordinate with Amruta, who is currently in KT sessions, so we can bring you both into the Daily Controls Monitoring KT together.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions as you go through onboarding or run into access issues. Looking forward to working closely with you.

Thanks,  
Kamran
