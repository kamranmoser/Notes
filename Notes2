Hi Shailesh,

Thank you for the kind note — I really appreciate you taking the time to share that feedback.

I’ve been intentional about increasing transparency and making sure the right stakeholders are looped in early, so it’s encouraging to hear that it’s landing the way I intended. I’ve learned a lot by observing how you and Vasanthan approach leadership and communication, and I’m trying to apply those principles in my day-to-day work.

I appreciate the support and guidance, and I’ll continue to lean into opportunities where I can add value and grow as a leader.

Thanks again.

Best regards,  
Kamran
