Subject: DQ App Integration: Autosys Jobs for EIQ → TechADS (Insert Scripts Attached)

Hi team,

Following up on our recent discussions, I’m sharing the details needed to move forward with the Autosys jobs for the DQ App integration into TechADS.

---

### Objective
Set up Autosys jobs to ingest EIQ Data Quality results into TechADS control tables to support daily DQ monitoring and downstream PARCM reporting.

---

### Autosys job requirements
- Job frequency: Daily  
- Data scope: Prior day (yesterday’s data)  
- Execution type: SQL-based Autosys job  
- Purpose: Load EIQ DQ results into TechADS control tables

---

### Attached artifact
- Insert scripts  
  - Show the source-to-target mapping  
  - Define the expected load logic for the Autosys job  
  - Can be used directly by the Change team to configure and schedule the job

(Only the insert scripts are required for this effort.)

---

### UI & promotion alignment
- Current DQ App UI and backend development is being tracked on the TECHQCARC Kanban board.
- As confirmed, the TECHQCARC board cannot promote code to production.
- All production promotion for the DQ App module (UI + backend integration) will be handled via the Change board.

Target milestones
- UAT: March  
- Production release: April (via Change board)

---

Please let me know if you need any clarifications or additional details to proceed with the Autosys setup. Happy to walk through the insert logic if helpful.

Thanks,  
Kamran
