Hi Amit,

Hope you’re doing well. I wanted to loop you in and get alignment with the EIQ and Change Dev teams on an approach we’re discussing for EIQ ingestion into TechADS.

Context
- The Controls team is building out a DQ App that consolidates daily DQ results (SLA, GVR, Nulls, Dupes, Deviation, etc.) in TechADS.
- For local TechADS DQ checks, we already have tables, inserts, and triggers in place.
- We’d like to bring EIQ DQ results into TechADS as well so they can be viewed, analyzed, and commented on in the same app and reporting flow.

What we’re trying to achieve
- Pull EIQ run results (failures + metadata) into TechADS tables.
- Keep EIQ as the source of truth, but land results in TechADS for:
  - Unified DQ visibility
  - RCA and analyst comments
  - PARCM and downstream reporting

Open questions we’d like to align on
- Best ingestion approach:
  - Autosys job pulling from EIQ?
  - Change-owned ingestion / distribute feed?
  - Lightweight module or job that extracts EIQ run results and lands them in Controls tables?
- What result-level data is available/appropriate to ingest (failure IDs, check type, status, timestamps, etc.).
- Ownership and sequencing (what belongs with EIQ vs. Change Dev vs. Controls).

Subashis and the Controls team felt it would be best to sync with you directly before locking in an approach. Happy to walk through what we’ve built so far and talk through options.

Would you be open to a short working session to align on this and decide next steps?

Thanks,  
Kamran

If you want, I can also:
- Make this even shorter
- Add a 1–2 line executive summary at the top
- Draft a calendar invite agenda for the follow-up meeting
