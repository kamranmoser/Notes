Title

Complete PLDM Assessments for January Intake Jira Tickets

⸻

Description

This task covers the completion of PLDM (Product & Lineage Data Management) assessments for all January intake Jira tickets related to TechADS DQ Controls and PARCM processes.

The assessment includes reviewing metadata impacts, validating ADS / ADST / AIT changes, and coordinating with relevant domain and development teams to ensure all PLDM requirements are satisfied prior to closure.

The goal is to ensure that all intake tickets are properly assessed, documented, and either approved or routed for follow-up remediation in alignment with governance and audit expectations.

⸻

Scope of Work
	•	Review all January intake Jira tickets requiring PLDM assessment
	•	Identify metadata, lineage, and control impacts
	•	Validate ADS / ADST / AIT changes against requirements
	•	Coordinate with BT, metadata, and development teams as needed
	•	Track assessment outcomes and ensure proper documentation
	•	Close assessments once requirements are met or follow-ups are assigned

⸻

Acceptance Criteria (Given / When / Then)

Given January intake Jira tickets requiring PLDM review are identified
When metadata, lineage, and control impacts are analyzed
Then each ticket has a completed PLDM assessment documented in Jira

⸻

Given ADS / ADST / AIT changes are part of an intake request
When validations are performed against PLDM standards
Then validation results are recorded and any gaps are clearly identified

⸻

Given an intake ticket requires follow-up actions or remediation
When coordination with relevant teams is completed
Then ownership, next steps, and tracking are documented in the ticket

	•	End Date: January 30, 2026

⸻

Notes for Kanban Sync
	•	Work is ongoing and dependent on intake volume and team responses
	•	Any blocked or delayed assessments should be surfaced during weekly DQC sync
	•	Follow-up actions should result in separate Jira stories where applicable

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	🔹 Do TECHQCARC-813 (SQL updates)
	•	🔹 Finish GT Reporting RCA
	•	🔹 Or batch-clean all remaining PARCM / BAU stories before the Kanban call

Just tell me which one to open next 👌
