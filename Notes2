Hi everyone,

Ahead of our walkthrough tomorrow, I wanted to share the high-level agenda so we can stay aligned and ensure we cover the full PARCM process end to end.

Agenda

1. PARCM Overview & Scope
   - What PARCM is measuring
   - Metrics in scope (DQ-001 / DQ-002 / DQ-003 / DM-001)
   - Monthly reporting expectations

2. PARCM Data Inputs
   - Daily DQ control results and failure capture
   - Control-level counts vs. metric-level rollups
   - How failures roll up into PARCM metrics

3. PARCM Calculation Logic
   - Pass / Fail / Total counts
   - Percent pass calculation
   - Metric status thresholds (Green / Yellow / Red)
   - Identifying out-of-tolerance metrics

4. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) & Action Planning
   - Reviewing failures by control type
   - Determining ownership and root cause
   - Drafting breach summaries and action plans

5. Using the Streamlit DQ & PARCM App
   - Generating the PARCM dataset
   - Reviewing failure details in the app
   - Exporting data to Excel (if needed)
   - Generating ORCIT upload templates
   - Generating the PARCM PowerPoint deck

6. PARCM Review & Submission Process
   - Review with Dev & Controls
   - Finalizing metrics and action plans
   - Submitting to Governance
   - Saving final artifacts and documentation

7. Next Steps & Q&A
   - Follow-up KT sessions (if needed)
   - Ownership and expectations going forward

Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like to make sure we spend extra time on during the session.

Thanks,  
Kamran
