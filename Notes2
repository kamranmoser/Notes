Hi Vedad and Namrata,

I’m in the process of finalizing the December PARCM metrics and wanted to align with you both on the GT Reporting controls results before submission.

I’ve attached:
1. December GT Reporting Controls summary report (showing total passed / failed by data source), and  
2. Detailed failures spreadsheet with job-level information.

Could you please help confirm the following:

- Data Source ID validation:  
  Please review the Data Source IDs included in the report and confirm that these are the correct and complete set for GT Reporting for December.

- Failure review / exclusions:  
  From the attached failures detail, please let me know if there are any failures that should be excluded (e.g., known issues, expected behavior, upstream dependencies, or non-reportable events).

If possible, I’d appreciate your feedback by [insert desired date] so I can incorporate any updates before finalizing the PARCM submission.

Thanks in advance for your help, and please let me know if you’d like to walk through the report together.

Best regards,  
Kamran
