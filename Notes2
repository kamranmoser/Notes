I wanted to share a quick update on the database work for the DQ/PARCM app. I’ve created the EIQ DQ tables in the Dev environment, so we now have the basic structures in place for the EIQ Null and EIQ Duplicate failure loads.

Before we finalize anything, we still need to confirm the exact table structure, specifically around how we plan to store the additional, non-source columns such as:
	•	Analyst comments
	•	Jira/story information
	•	RCA inputs
	•	Other user-entered metadata

As discussed, these fields should not live in the main failure tables, and we will need a separate comments/additional metadata table that links back to each failure. We still need alignment on:
	1.	What columns the metadata table should contain
	2.	How the primary key relationship should work between:
	•	Base failure tables
	•	Comments/metadata table
	3.	How Autosys will populate the base tables vs. how the Angular UI will populate the metadata table
	4.	How we will handle updates, auditing, and historical records

Once we finalize the design, I can update the table structures accordingly and begin preparing the insert scripts for Autosys.

Let me know once we have clarity on the metadata approach so I can apply the final structure to Dev.
