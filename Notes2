Got it — here’s a clear, governance-ready closure comment you can drop straight into TECHQCARC-870. It aligns cleanly with the acceptance criteria and documents exactly what audit or governance would expect to see.

Jira Comment / Closure Update

This task is being closed following completion of the PLDM assessments for all January intake Jira tickets.

Summary of Work Completed
	•	Reviewed and assessed all January intake tickets received from the Governance team.
	•	Evaluated each ticket to determine applicable impact areas, including:
	•	Metadata (PLDM) impacts
	•	BT Converge impacts
	•	PTSR impacts
	•	New or changed ADS considerations
	•	Documented assessment outcomes within the respective Jira tickets to ensure traceability and audit alignment.
	•	Confirmed whether follow-up actions were required for metadata updates, BT Converge onboarding, PTSR updates, or ADS changes.
	•	Sent notification to the Governance team confirming completion of PLDM assessments and requesting follow-up with the appropriate domain or application teams where additional information or remediation is required.

All PLDM assessment requirements for the January intake have been satisfied, and ownership for any downstream follow-up actions has been appropriately handed back to Governance and the impacted teams.

If you want, I can also:
	•	Standardize this into a monthly PLDM intake closure template, or
	•	Add a short audit-specific sentence calling out alignment to PLDM policy and control expectations.
