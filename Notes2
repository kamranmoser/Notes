Hi Lakshmi,

Can you help analyze the daily control completion times by domain so we can determine when to schedule the automated reports?

We’re mainly looking for:
- When the last control typically completes per domain  
- A reasonable buffer time for sending the daily email  

Let me know if you need anything from my side.

Thanks,  
Kamran
