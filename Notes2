Quick update — I discussed the SQL/table design with the team, and we’ve confirmed we won’t need the Master Failure table going forward.

Since FAILURE_PK is globally unique, we’ll link everything directly by:
	•	FAILURE_COMMENTS.FAILURE_PK → each DQ table’s FAILURE_PK

So the app/UI can pull failures from the target DQ table and join to FAILURE_COMMENTS to display the full comment history.
