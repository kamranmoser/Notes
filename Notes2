Throughout 2025, I drove operational excellence by improving the consistency, efficiency, and reliability of TechADS DQC processes and reporting. I supported the development and execution of DQ controls aligned with TechADS Process Owner and ADS Manager priorities, helping ensure stable BAU operations across EIQ and EMP.

I was responsible for producing and submitting monthly PARCM metrics to ORCIT, ensuring accurate calculations, timely delivery, and clear escalation of data quality issues. I actively identified inefficiencies within the PARCM process, reduced manual effort through standardization and repeatable workflows, and improved transparency into metric performance and failure trends.

I partnered closely with TechADS, EIQ, EMP, and governance teams to resolve architecture, data ingestion, and reporting issues that impacted operational stability. Through these collaborations, I helped drive quicker issue resolution, reduce recurring failures, and support data-driven decision making.

In addition, I contributed to continuous improvement efforts by refining documentation, clarifying ownership and handoffs, and identifying opportunities to enhance DQ reporting and control execution. My focus on operational discipline, process improvement, and cross-team collaboration helped strengthen platform maturity and ensured dependable delivery of DQC outputs throughout the year.
