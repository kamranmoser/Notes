Key Takeaways
	•	Master failure table is officially out of scope
	•	PK generation will use sequence + trigger with prefixes
	•	FAILURE_COMMENTS remains the only user-editable table
	•	EIQ tables are defined but not yet integrated
	•	Insert scripts must be aligned to UAT logic, not Dev
	•	No urgency to rush — quality and alignment preferred over speed
