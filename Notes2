Hi Subashis,

Following up after today’s call — unfortunately Amit and you weren’t able to join, so I wanted to summarize where we landed and request help getting this work moving.

What we’re trying to do  
The Controls team needs to ingest all EIQ data quality results into TechADS so they can be consumed by the DQ / PARCM app we’re building. This includes EIQ run-level failure results and associated metadata.

Proposed approach (discussed on the call):
- Pull data directly from the existing EIQ reporting views
- Land the results into TechADS Controls-owned tables
- Run this ingestion on a scheduled basis via Autosys
- EIQ remains the source of truth; TechADS simply consumes the results for UI, RCA, and PARCM reporting

From a technical standpoint, it sounds like this should be feasible via an Autosys job that queries the EIQ reporting views and inserts the results into TechADS.

What I’m providing:
- The SQL scripts/queries that define exactly what EIQ data we need to ingest (failures + metadata)
- The target table structures in TechADS that the DQ app will read from

What we need help with:
- Adding a story to the Change Dev board to track this work
- Assigning ownership to set up the Autosys job for the EIQ → TechADS ingestion
- Confirming any prerequisites (service ID, access, scheduling constraints, etc.)

Once the story is created, I’m happy to walk through the SQL and answer any questions to help get this implemented.

Thanks,  
Kamran
