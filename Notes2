Hi Team,

Thank you for joining the sync tomorrow to discuss the TechADS EIQ run scheduling issue. Below is the proposed agenda to ensure we align on immediate remediation and long-term prevention.

---

### Agenda

1. Issue Overview
   - Summary of what occurred (EIQ runs falling off schedule after 12/31)
   - Impact to TechADS controls and PARCM reporting

2. Current State Assessment
   - Confirmation of which TechADS EIQ runs are currently unscheduled
   - Review of the run inventory (based on prior week’s run IDs, timing, and frequency)

3. Rescheduling Approach (Near-Term Fix)
   - Options for bulk rescheduling existing run IDs through 12/31/2026
   - Clarification on ownership:
     - Can EIQ team reschedule on our behalf?
     - If not, guidance on steps TechADS should follow to reschedule correctly
   - Expected timeline to fully restore all runs

4. Prevention & Control Enhancements (Future State)
   - Ideas to prevent recurrence (e.g., scheduling checks, alerts, annual calendar validation)
   - Potential ownership model for schedule maintenance going forward
   - Opportunities for automation or governance checkpoints

5. Next Steps & Action Items
   - Confirm owners and deadlines for rescheduling
   - Agree on preventative actions and follow-ups
   - Determine any documentation or validation needed post-reschedule

Looking forward to aligning and getting this resolved quickly.

Thanks,  
Kamran
