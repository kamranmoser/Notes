Hi Jeff,

Thanks again for the discussion. I wanted to follow up with a high-level clarification on how we approach SLAs and downstream inventory across TechADS domains, based on the questions raised during Metric QA.

SLA Model Overview
SLAs are applied only to scheduled, provisioned data feeds (e.g., TechADS to downstream platforms such as RDR, Distribute, or equivalent provisioning layers). These SLAs are measured at the TechADS-to-next-hop boundary, and a single SLA may cover multiple downstream consumers when data is delivered through a shared provisioning mechanism.

In contrast, REST APIs and other consumer-driven access patterns are pull-based and inherently variable. Consumers, volumes, and usage frequency can change month to month, and failures are typically driven by request parameters or usage behavior rather than data delivery issues. As a result, these access patterns are treated as observational and are not governed by delivery SLAs.

Downstream Inventory Approach
Due to the dynamic nature of downstream consumption (e.g., onboarding/offboarding of API consumers), maintaining a static, permanent downstream asset list is not feasible or representative. Instead, downstream completeness is addressed through:
	•	Monthly evidence snapshots reflecting actual consumers during the reporting period
	•	Subscriber or provisioning extracts when required
	•	Explicit governance statements documenting the dynamic nature of downstream usage

This approach ensures downstream inventory remains controlled, traceable, and defensible, while accurately reflecting real-world consumption.

We are aligning the Control Metric documentation to reflect this model so that it clearly matches what is measured for DQ-002, and we’ll have the updated materials ready ahead of the next governance checkpoint.

Please let me know if you’d like to review the updates together or if any additional clarification would be helpful.

Thanks,
Kamran
