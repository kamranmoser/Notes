Quick question as we’re finalizing SQL and load logic for the DQ/PARCM app. We’re trying to confirm the expected approach for handling EIQ failure data.

Do you know whether EIQ failures (nulls, dupes, recon, etc.) are expected to be:
	•	Loaded into TechADS/Controls schemas by a Change-owned process, or
	•	Pulled/ingested directly by the Controls team (via Autosys or app logic)?

TechADS Dev mentioned this decision likely sits with the Change team, so we wanted to confirm before locking down our design.
