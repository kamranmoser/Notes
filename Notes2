Hi [Teammate Name],  

Thanks again for hopping on the call. As discussed, our TechADS EIQ runs fell off the schedule after 12/31, so we currently have no EIQ controls running.  

Request: Please reschedule the runs through 12/31/2026, using the same Run IDs, execution times, and frequencies from the attached spreadsheet. Priority is Recon runs first, then the remaining runs.

### Step-by-step (EIQ)
1. Log into EIQ  
2. Navigate to: Data Quality → DQ Execution → Schedule Run Execution  
3. Set filters:
   - Source System: TechADS  
   - Group Name: TechADS  
4. Update the date range:
   - Start Date: [use today or 01/08/2026]  
   - End Date: 12/31/2026  
5. For each run in the attached file:
   - Select the Run ID
   - Confirm the Execution Type matches what we used previously
   - Set the same schedule time and frequency (daily/weekly/etc.)
   - Save/submit the schedule
6. Start with Recon runs first (these are most critical), then proceed with the rest.
7. After saving, refresh and confirm each scheduled run shows:
   - Next run date/time populated
   - Correct recurrence pattern
   - End date = 12/31/2026

### Confirmation needed
Once you’ve scheduled the Recon runs, can you please reply back confirming:
- Which Recon Run IDs were scheduled
- The next run date/time is visible
- End date shows 12/31/2026

Attached: Spreadsheet with prior run list (Run IDs, time, frequency)

Thank you!  
Kamran
