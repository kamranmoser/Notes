1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Controls team (Kamran, Tashu, Atharva) has built two Streamlit-based tools used for daily and monthly TechADS data quality operations:

Daily DQ App
• Runs daily DQ checks (SLA, GVR, API, Nulls, Dupes, Deviation, Intraday)
• Generates daily DQ Excel and email
• Currently runs on local Streamlit with Windows Task Scheduler

PARCM App
• Runs monthly Key Measure Metrics for PARCM domains
• Supports exclusions and RCA
• Generates PARCM PPT and ORCIT upload file
• Future state: submit metrics directly to ORCIT via API

Long-term goal:
Convert both into a unified Angular + Spring Boot + Autosys production application hosted in TechADS Dashboard.

2. NEW INFORMATION FROM LATEST CALLS (NOV 18 & 19)

2.1 Hosting Model Clarified (Major Development)

The TechADS Dev team provided clear direction:
	•	A new standalone app/server cannot be created for Controls.
	•	Hosting must occur inside the existing TechADS Dashboard.
	•	Controls will create a module inside dashboard code (Angular).
	•	Dashboard will handle:
• Page creation
• Routing
• Role-based access
• Java API layer (dashboard service)
	•	Controls’ backend logic (Python) can remain in your Bitbucket repo and be executed via API triggers.

(From Nov 19 call)  ￼

This is the final direction: Angular inside Dashboards only — no new service, no new UI host, no new server.

2.2 Angular Folder Structure Guidance

Per Dev team:
	•	Angular code for Controls must be placed under the modules folder in Dashboard app.
	•	A new module called “controls” can be created.
	•	PARCM and Daily DQ can each be submodules inside that Controls module.
	•	Controls team will need Angular access (UI code) in the Dashboard repo.

(From Nov 19 call)  ￼

2.3 Backend Logic Handling
	•	Python logic (data extraction, evidence building, PPT creation, ORCIT logic) can stay in Python.
	•	Java/Spring services from Dashboard will call Python where needed.
	•	Dashboard Java layer handles database reads/writes and API endpoints.

(From Nov 19 call)  ￼

2.4 CI/CD Clarification
	•	Controls cannot maintain its own independent CI/CD pipeline.
	•	Angular code must follow TechADS Dashboard CI/CD cycle.
	•	Releases are grouped with Dashboard releases.

(From Nov 19 call)  ￼

2.5 Regarding Stories and Code Check-ins
	•	Controls team cannot push Angular code using your current board.
	•	Dashboard Dev team must create:
• Proper Jira stories in their board
• Branching structure
• Permissions for Controls team to check in code
	•	Sylvia or Subashis will confirm structure and access.

(From Nov 19 call)  ￼

2.6 Confirmation Needed from Sylvia (Still Pending)
	•	Sylvia needs to review the Streamlit demo materials.
	•	She will confirm:
• Where Controls module will live
• How routing will work
• How Python scripts will be wired
• How “Control” pages will appear on dashboard

(From Nov 19 call)  ￼

2.7 EMP and EIQ Clarifications

During the internal Nov 18 call, key clarifications were reached:
	•	EMP stores domain metadata and schema definitions for all transport ADS tables.
	•	EMP is used today for:
• verifying schema mismatches
• validating nullability
• resolving EIQ control failures
	•	The Controls app can leverage EMP DB to validate schema-based issues.
	•	EIQ failures in the Daily DQ app should map 1:1 with EIQ dashboard results.

(From Nov 18 internal call)  ￼

2.8 EIQ Automation and Gaps
	•	EIQ duplicate checks for RMO & Change can be automated once table structures are ready.
	•	Some EIQ controls (custom validations) do not appear in EIQ backend tables; this must be investigated.
	•	Controls team needs access to EMP/EIQ DB to automate evidence.

(From Nov 18 internal call)  ￼

2.9 Confluence Documentation Needs Improvement
	•	Need to convert attached documents into actual Confluence pages (not downloads).
	•	Controls team will restructure the DQ/PARCM documentation.
	•	Dev team requested access-friendly format.

(From Nov 18 internal call)  ￼

2.10 Tomorrow’s Dev Call (Preparation)

You and Tashu need to:
	•	Prepare agenda for the next Dev call
	•	Add questions for Angular hosting
	•	Add SSO/CIQ concerns
	•	Confirm what remaining decisions are needed
	•	Identify what tables still need to be built
	•	Bring app instructions and architecture documents

(From Nov 18 internal call)  ￼

3. UPDATED CURRENT STATE (AFTER NEW CALLS)

Functional (Streamlit MVP)

Daily DQ and PARCM apps work end-to-end.

Required for Production
	•	Must migrate to Angular + Spring Boot inside Dashboard
	•	Cannot create a new server or separate app
	•	Must follow Dashboard CI/CD
	•	Need Dev team to create the Controls module and routing

Controls Schema
	•	Some tables created (e.g., SLA_DQ).
	•	Pending finalization of:
• PARCM evidence tables
• GVR_DQ tables
• EIQ tables
• ORCIT logging tables

Autosys
	•	Not yet started.
	•	Must be aligned with dashboard service/APIs after Spring Boot layer is defined.

Documentation
	•	Process guides created (Daily DQ + PARCM user guide).
	•	Need proper Confluence pages.

SSO
	•	UAT tokens working.
	•	PROD CIQ still pending SSO team response.

4. UPDATED NEXT STEPS (AFTER NEW CALLS)

Immediate (Next Few Days)
	1.	Finalize agenda/questions for tomorrow’s Dev call.
	2.	Convert all documentation into Confluence pages.

	2.	Provide insert logic to Dev team.
	3.	Dev builds Autosys job definitions once endpoints are defined.

EIQ & EMP Integration
	1.	Get full DB access to EMP and EIQ schemas.
	2.	Validate coverage of EIQ controls (duplicates, nulls, etc.).
	3.	Map missing EIQ logic into Controls schema tables.

SSO & ORCIT
	1.	Follow up with Vaibhav on CIQ details.
	2.	Confirm PROD client ID process and timeline.
