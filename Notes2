Hi Hayley,

I hope you’ve been doing well! It’s been a while since we worked together at Insight Global, so I wanted to reach out and see if you’re still with the team.

If you are, I have a close friend who is beginning a job search, and I wanted to ask if you’d be open to connecting with him or helping point him toward any potential opportunities. Completely understand if your bandwidth is limited — no pressure at all.

Either way, it would be great to reconnect. Hope all has been well on your end!

Best,  
Kamran
