Subject: Control Metric Documentation Updates – Review Requested

Hi team,

I’ve completed the required updates to the control metric documentation across all four domains (GT Reporting, Record Management & Operations, Application, and Change Management).

Updates include:
- Adding a standardized DQ-002 calculation statement to each control document
- Updating the Application domain asset list to remove BT Converge, as it is not currently in scope

I’ve attached the link to the shared drive with the updated documents below for your review.  
Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions or if any additional updates are needed.

Thanks,  
Kamran
