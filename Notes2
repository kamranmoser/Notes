Throughout 2025, I contributed to responsible growth by strengthening the TechADS DQC control framework and improving the scalability and usability of DQ reporting and metrics across supported platforms. My work focused on enabling downstream teams and stakeholders with clearer, more reliable insights to support decision-making and platform maturity.

I supported the onboarding, validation, and reporting of DQ metrics for source systems across EIQ and TechADS, helping expand control coverage and improve transparency into data quality health. By partnering with TechADS process owners, ADS managers, and governance teams, I helped align DQ execution with broader business and platform objectives.

I also contributed to growth through continuous improvement of the PARCM metrics process, ensuring consistent monthly delivery to ORCIT while identifying opportunities to enhance efficiency, reduce manual effort, and improve reusability of reporting logic. These efforts helped position the DQC function for future scale as additional metrics and domains are onboarded.

In addition, I supported the resolution of architecture and development issues across TechADS, EIQ, and EMP, enabling smoother data ingestion and reporting workflows. My focus on collaboration, documentation, and process clarity helped strengthen platform stability while laying the groundwork for sustainable growth in DQ capabilities.
