Here’s a clean, concise set of meeting notes Lakshmi can reference to complete the task confidently. This is written in a “handoff-ready” format you can send directly to her or store in Confluence.

Meeting Notes: Daily Control Completion Time Analysis

Purpose: Determine when all daily controls finish by domain so automated domain-level reports can be scheduled correctly.

Attendees:
	•	Kamran
	•	Lakshmi

Context:
We need to identify the latest completion time of daily controls for each domain to ensure automated Autosys reports are triggered after all controls have completed, avoiding incomplete or partial reporting.

⸻

What We Are Trying to Determine

For each domain, identify:
	•	When the last control finishes running on a typical day
	•	Across all relevant control types, including:
	•	Upstream SLA
	•	Downstream SLA
	•	GVR
	•	Deviation
	•	Null checks
	•	Duplicate checks
	•	Any other daily controls applicable to the domain

The key data point used to determine completion is the INSERT_DTM timestamp.

Approach Discussed

1. Query Control Execution Data
	•	Use the controls repo → Auxiliary scripts (e.g., Application, Change, GT Reporting, etc.).
	•	Run queries by domain and control type.
	•	Pull at least one full day of data initially (can expand to multiple days for averaging).

2. Focus on INSERT_DTM
	•	The INSERT_DTM column represents when a control record was written (i.e., control completion).
	•	For each control type:
	•	Identify the maximum INSERT_DTM value for that day.
	•	This represents the latest completion time for that control.

3. Export to Excel for Analysis
	•	Export query results to Excel.
	•	Use Excel to:
	•	Group by control type
	•	Identify max completion times
	•	Compare across control types
	•	Determine the latest overall completion time per domain.

4. Repeat for All Domains
	•	Perform the same analysis for:
	•	Application
	•	Change
	•	Records Management
	•	Operations
	•	GT Reporting (G2)
	•	One domain at a time.
	•	Share results incrementally as each domain is completed.

⸻

Expected Output

For each domain:
	•	A summary showing:
	•	Each control type
	•	Typical completion time
	•	Latest completion time overall
	•	This will be used to:
	•	Define Autosys scheduling times
	•	Ensure automated reports run after all controls complete

⸻

Timeline / Next Steps
	•	Lakshmi will begin analysis immediately.
	•	Target to have initial domain results shared as they are completed.
	•	Goal is to provide enough data by end of the week for the dev team to begin scheduling Autosys jobs.

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Turn this into a step-by-step checklist Lakshmi can follow
	•	Create a template Excel layout for how to organize the results
	•	Draft a follow-up email once she completes the first domain
