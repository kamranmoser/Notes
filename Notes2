Jira Comment / Closure Update

This story is being closed following completion of the PARCM metric calculation walkthrough with the Governance and Architecture teams.

Summary of Work Completed
	•	Delivered an end-to-end walkthrough of the PARCM metric calculation process, including how daily DQ controls roll up into monthly PARCM metrics.
	•	Reviewed inputs, exclusions, thresholds, and outputs, with a focus on how ingestion (DQ-001), provisioning (DQ-002), and data quality checks (DQ-003) are calculated and aggregated.
	•	Demonstrated the daily controls process, root cause analysis workflow, exclusion handling (e.g., planned outages), and how adjusted results feed PARCM reporting.
	•	Explained supporting tooling and artifacts, including TechADS controls, supporting queries, spreadsheets, and downstream reporting outputs (SharePoint / ORCIT).
	•	Addressed Governance and Architecture questions related to SLA configuration, provisioning patterns (tables vs APIs), audit traceability, and future-state automation.
	•	Captured feedback and follow-up considerations for documentation updates and future enhancements (where applicable).

The walkthrough objectives were met, and no additional action items are required for this task at this time.
