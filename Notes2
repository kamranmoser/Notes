Meeting Summary

We reviewed the updated SQL DDL and INSERT scripts for the DQ / PARCM application and aligned on the final table structure, failure ID strategy, comments handling, and next steps for EIQ integration.

Key Decisions & Discussion Points

1. Failure Table Restructuring
	•	Agreed to remove additional metadata columns from the 10 DQ failure tables.
	•	Failure tables will retain only core failure attributes.
	•	Each failure table will include a generated FAILURE_PK.
	•	FAILURE_PK will be created using a sequence and trigger and serve as the unique identifier for each failure record.

2. FAILURE_COMMENTS Table
	•	A new FAILURE_COMMENTS table will be created to store all comments and supplemental metadata.
	•	Design decisions:
	•	COMMENT_ID will be the primary key.
	•	FAILURE_ID will be a foreign key referencing the failure table FAILURE_PK.
	•	One failure can have multiple comments.
	•	USER_NAME will be captured to track who made each update.
	•	Comment timestamps will be stored as a DATE.

3. INSERT Script Updates
	•	INSERT scripts were updated to:
	•	Populate only core failure columns and FAILURE_PK.
	•	Remove embedded comment and metadata fields.
	•	RUN_DATE remains parameterized and will be passed in by Autosys.
	•	Jobs will continue to load prior-day (retro) data, consistent with current behavior.

4. EIQ Failure Integration
	•	EIQ failures originate from a separate database/service ID.
	•	Direct DB link access is not a preferred or approved solution.
	•	Likely path forward is for TechADS Dev to:
	•	Load EIQ failures via Autosys or
	•	Use a Python-based integration to write EIQ results into Controls schemas.
	•	This approach will be confirmed with the Dev team.

5. EIQ Failure Tables
	•	New EIQ failure tables have been created (Duplicate, Null, Reconciliation).
	•	These tables follow the same FAILURE_PK + sequence/trigger pattern.
	•	EIQ tables were not part of earlier deliveries and are new additions.

⸻

Open Items / Questions
	•	Confirm final approach for EIQ data ingestion with TechADS Dev.
	•	Align on ownership for EIQ load logic (Autosys vs Python).
	•	Confirm any Dev-side standards for ID prefixes or promotion workflows.

⸻

Next Steps
	•	Finalize FAILURE_COMMENTS table DDL and foreign key constraints.
	•	Share updated SQL scripts once EIQ ingestion approach is confirmed.
	•	Schedule follow-up discussion with TechADS Dev to close EIQ integration items.
