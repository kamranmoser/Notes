Hi Amruta,

Thanks again for taking the time to connect earlier this week. I wanted to follow up with a quick recap of what we covered and outline the next steps as you continue onboarding with the TechADS DQ Controls team.

What we covered:
- Overview of the TechADS DQ Controls Team Hub and how it’s used as the central location for documentation, process guides, and team references.
- Walkthrough of the onboarding Confluence site, including steps for requesting and tracking required system access.
- High-level overview of the Daily DQC Monitoring process, including:
  - Monitoring control executions across control types  
  - Performing initial root cause analysis  
  - Identifying the responsible team (upstream / downstream / TechADS)  
  - Tracking remediation and updates for each failure
- Brief discussion of related areas such as:
  - PARCM submission process
  - Daily DQ & PARCM app
  - EIQ
  - TechADS control metric documentation

Next steps:
- Please continue progressing through your current KT sessions and onboarding materials.
- We’ll continue aligning with your ongoing KT sessions, and I’ll plan to include Sridarshan alongside you for the Daily Controls Monitoring KT, so you’re both aligned and get the same walkthrough.
- I’ll also coordinate with Lakshmi to ensure the appropriate Jira stories are in place for tracking this work.
- As needed, we can schedule additional deep-dive sessions to walk through the daily monitoring workflow, tools, and expectations in more detail.

Let me know if you have any questions in the meantime or if there’s anything specific you’d like to prioritize as part of the upcoming KT sessions.

Thanks,  
Kamran
