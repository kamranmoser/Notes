Following our recent discussions with the TechADS Dev team regarding the DQ/PARCM application migration to Angular + Spring Boot, we need your guidance on a few items so that our team can begin development in alignment with TechADS standards.

Specifically, we need clarification on the following:

⸻

1. Repo Structure & Dashboard Alignment

Sylvia confirmed that the Controls team will need to place our Angular module inside the TechADS Dashboard repo under the modules directory.
Before we can begin contributing code, we need confirmation on:
	•	Whether the Controls team will be given contributor access to the Dashboard Angular repo.
	•	Any required onboarding steps for repo access (e.g., permissions, access groups, etc.).

⸻

2. Jira Board & Commit Hook Requirements

The Dashboard repo enforces strict commit hooks that require valid Jira stories from the TechADS change board.
Since our Controls board does not currently enforce these hooks, we need to understand the expected workflow:
	•	Should DQ/PARCM development stories be created under the TechADS board going forward?
	•	Can commit hooks be enabled for the Controls board, or do we need to migrate work items into your board?
	•	Any additional requirements for Controls team to be included under the TechADS change management process?

This clarification will determine where we create our user stories and how code promotions will be handled.

⸻

3. CI/CD and Branching Expectations

In order to structure our Angular module correctly, we need alignment on:
	•	Branching strategy the Controls team should follow
	•	Expected release cycles, build pipelines, or any Controls-specific requirements
	•	Whether our code will follow the same CI/CD path as the Dashboard application

⸻

Once we have your guidance on the above items, our team (Tashu, Atharva, and myself) can begin building the Angular UI using the correct structure, commit process, and development workflow.

Please let me know if you’d prefer a quick call to walk through this. We are ready to proceed as soon as we receive your direction.
