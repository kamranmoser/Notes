Throughout 2025, I contributed to a positive and inclusive work environment by being a dependable and collaborative partner to teammates, stakeholders, and leadership across TechADS, EIQ, EMP, and governance teams. I consistently demonstrated ownership, accountability, and transparency in my work, ensuring expectations were clearly communicated and commitments were met.

I actively supported collaboration and open communication by proactively engaging stakeholders, aligning on priorities, and helping bring clarity to complex or ambiguous initiatives. I welcomed feedback, shared knowledge, and maintained clear documentation and structured updates to help teammates succeed and reduce friction across teams.

In addition to my day-to-day responsibilities, I was heavily involved in the employee network through the Community Outreach Committee (Charlotte chapter). As a Volunteer Event Manager, I helped plan, coordinate, and host multiple volunteer events throughout the year. These efforts supported community engagement, strengthened employee connections, and reinforced the firm’s commitment to service and social responsibility.

I also invested in my personal development and consistently looked for opportunities to improve processes, strengthen partnerships, and contribute positively to team morale. Through my collaboration, community involvement, and commitment to continuous improvement, I helped foster a work environment rooted in trust, inclusion, and shared success.
