Hi Aswathy,

I wanted to follow up after the recent Metric QA discussions (including the review with Vidya/Joshua and the follow-up alignment call with Jeff, Tara, and Vedad) to make sure we’re fully aligned on the updates needed for the control metric document.

At a high level, governance is aligned with the overall approach — the focus now is ensuring the documentation clearly reflects how the metric is actually calculated and evidenced, in a way that is consistent and defensible across all domains.

Key items to confirm alignment on:

1. Target Asset Scope
   - The control metric document should reflect one-hop provisioning targets only (i.e., direct TechADS → downstream provisioning).
   - Multi-hop downstream chains should be excluded, as they are out of scope for this control.

2. API / Dynamic Consumers
   - REST/API consumers are inherently dynamic and can vary month-to-month.
   - These should be treated as point-in-time snapshots aligned to the reporting period, not as a fixed/static inventory.
   - SLAs apply to scheduled/provisioned feeds, not to ad-hoc API pulls.

3. Governance Statement / Documentation Clarity
   - The document should explicitly state that:
     - Target assets are recalculated monthly
     - Evidence reflects actual activity for the reporting period
     - API consumers are consumer-driven and not schedule-driven
     - SLAs are measured at the provisioning boundary (table/view availability), not individual API calls

4. Source Asset Clean-Up
   - Any assets that do not flow into TechADS should be removed from scope to avoid confusion during QA review.

The goal is for the control metric document, monthly evidence, and metric logic to all tell the same story, so governance can easily reconcile what’s being measured without needing additional context.

Let me know if this aligns with your understanding or if you’d like to quickly walk through any of this together before finalizing. Happy to review once you’ve incorporated the updates.

Thanks again for partnering on this.

Best,  
Kamran
