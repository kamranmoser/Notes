Hi Aswathy,  
Hi Lakshmi,

I wanted to follow up on the recent Metric QA discussions we had (including the Jan 6 review with Vidya Joshua and the follow-up confirmation with Jeff, Tara, and Vedad) to make sure we’re aligned on the control metric update approach as you continue working through the documents.

Below is a consolidated summary of the agreed-upon direction and what needs to be reflected in the control metric documentation. This guidance is generalized and applies across all domains, not just Change.

### Key Takeaways from Metric QA Discussions

1. Target Asset Scope (One-Hop Only)  
- Control metrics should include only one-hop provisioning targets directly downstream of TechADS.  
- Multi-hop paths (e.g., TechADS → intermediate → downstream consumer) are out of scope for the metric.  
- The intent is for the control metric to align exactly with what is being measured and evidenced.

2. REST / API Consumers  
- API consumers are dynamic and consumer-driven, with onboarding/offboarding occurring regularly.  
- APIs should not be treated as static target assets in the control metric document.  
- Instead:
  - Reference APIs via a governance statement
  - Treat API consumer listings as point-in-time snapshots aligned to the reporting period evidence

3. SLA Applicability  
- SLAs apply to scheduled / provisioned feeds only.  
- REST/API interactions are pull-based and ad-hoc and therefore do not have meaningful delivery SLAs.  
- This distinction should be clearly documented to avoid inflating target counts or creating misalignment with evidence.

4. Monthly Recalculation & Evidence Alignment  
- Target asset counts are recalculated monthly based on actual provisioning activity.  
- Evidence reflects the state of activity for the reporting period, not a fixed inventory.  
- This dynamic approach was reviewed and accepted, as long as it is clearly documented.

5. Source Asset Clean-Up  
- Source assets that do not flow into TechADS should be removed from the control metric scope.  
- Only assets that actively participate in the TechADS data flow should be represented.

### What to Update in the Control Metric Document

- Clearly define in-scope one-hop targets
- Remove multi-hop downstream references
- Add or refine the governance statement covering:
  - Dynamic target recalculation
  - API treatment
  - SLA applicability
- Ensure the document visually and logically matches what DQ-002 is measuring and what monthly evidence supports

Please let me know if this aligns with your understanding, or if you’d like to walk through anything together before finalizing updates. Happy to review once changes are in, or jump on a quick sync if helpful.

Thanks for all the work you’re doing on this.

Best,
