Hi Team,

Sharing notes and takeaways from the Daily Controls Monitoring KT session held with Amruta and Sridarshan.

Attendees: Kamran, Amruta, Sridarshan

## Summary
This was a foundational KT to establish a shared understanding of the Daily DQC monitoring workflow (detection → understanding → documentation → escalation → tracking), review where documentation lives, confirm access needs, and provide a high-level walkthrough of EIQ and the Daily DQ Streamlit app used to generate/export daily failures for analysis.

---

## Key Topics Covered

### 1) DQ Controls Team Hub (Confluence)
- Reviewed the DQ Controls Team Hub as the single source of truth for:
  - Daily DQC process guide / playbooks
  - Onboarding + access documentation
  - Links to tools and supporting references
- Reinforced that team members don’t need to memorize steps—use the playbooks as needed.

### 2) Access / Onboarding Items
- Confirmed Prod DB access is mandatory for daily controls monitoring; access to other environments is helpful for future automation work.
- Noted that access can be revoked if unused for an extended period; recommended periodic logins to retain access.
- Addressed Jira access issue (read-only vs contribute):
  - Submitted/requested Jira board “contribute” access via Horizon for both Amruta and Sridarshan.
- Confirmed no immediate need for additional Unix/AD groups for current responsibilities (may be needed later depending on project work).
- Flagged that EMP access instructions on the hub needed updating; Kamran added updated EMP instructions.

### 3) Daily DQC Monitoring – Mental Model & Workflow
- Reinforced goal: ensure data is fit for use / fit for purpose, timeliness, and support downstream reporting (including PARCM).
- Standard workflow:
  1. Run/review control outputs
  2. Identify failures
  3. Capture failures in tracking spreadsheet
  4. Perform initial RCA using logs and available evidence
  5. Escalate to the appropriate team if needed
  6. Track remediation via Jira/story follow-up until resolved
- Emphasized: the role is not to “fix everything” immediately; focus is on accurate documentation, ownership, and consistent follow-up.

### 4) Control Types (High-Level)
- SLA checks: timeliness of loads
- GVR: source vs target record count alignment (feeds DM-001)
- Deviation: day-over-day record count monitoring (default 10% unless configured otherwise)
- Null / Duplicate: metadata-driven validation of non-nullable and uniqueness expectations
- Intraday: multiple daily loads; escalate if repeated failures
- REST API checks: typically user error; review logs for failure reason

### 5) PARCM Metric Tie-In (High-Level)
- Explained how daily controls roll up into PARCM metrics:
  - DQ-001: data received & processed (upstream)
  - DQ-002: data provisioned (downstream)
  - DQ-003: data quality checks (null/dupe/deviation, etc.)
  - DM-001: data loss (GVR)

### 6) EIQ Overview
- Reviewed EIQ as a flexible platform for DQ checks (especially null/dupe/custom checks), and for Change domain recon/GVR-type monitoring.
- Clarified: not all TechADS controls are in EIQ; controls exist across Oracle + EIQ.
- Noted that the current app may not pull EIQ failures yet; the enhanced version will ingest EIQ results into TechADS views/dashboards.

### 7) EIQ Access Issue & Resolution
- Both Amruta and Sridarshan could access the EIQ application but reported disabled reports (likely missing permissions).
- Kamran located and added updated EIQ ARM access instructions to the team hub and will support escalation to EIQ if additional enablement is needed after ARM approval.

### 8) Streamlit Daily DQ App Walkthrough
- Demonstrated how to run the app:
  - Open repo in VS Code → terminal → run Streamlit app
  - App executes multiple control queries (SLA, GVR, null/dupe, deviation, etc.)
  - Results can be viewed in UI or exported to Excel for RCA and documentation
- Noted current app outputs “today + prior day”; the newer version will be prior-day only (to align with future Autosys scheduling).
- Reiterated value: replaces manual copy/paste workflow and saves significant time.

---

## Decisions / Agreements
- Daily controls monitoring will proceed using exported spreadsheets initially, while access and app setup are completed.
- Next KT will be more hands-on and focus on performing RCA and escalation/tracking for real failures.

---

## Action Items

1) Jira Board Access
- Kamran: Submit/confirm “contribute” access for Amruta + Sridarshan on TECHQC Jira board (Horizon request).

2) EIQ Access
- Amruta & Sridarshan: Submit ARM request using the updated instructions on the hub and re-check access after approval.
- Kamran: Follow up with EIQ team if reports remain disabled after ARM approval / if additional enablement steps are required.

3) Daily DQ App Setup
- Sridarshan: Attempt to run the app locally; coordinate with Tashu if any dependencies/setup issues arise.
- Amruta: Coordinate with Tashu/Patrick to clone repo and get app running locally (timing dependent on office / weather).

4) Tableau Access
- Kamran: Reach out to Eric for Tableau access/request steps and share with Amruta + Sridarshan.

5) Next Session
- Kamran: Schedule a follow-up KT focused on hands-on RCA (log review, ownership determination, escalation, Jira tracking).
