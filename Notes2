Hi JK and Sebastian,

I’m currently compiling the December PARCM metrics and noticed that one of our Alteryx jobs is in an ON HOLD status and has been missing SLA beginning 12/8.

From the SLA log and Autosys details, the job appears to be:
ALTERYX_GCEAC_CHR_SUP_DTL_3004_3005_6021

I’ve attached the SLA log and Autosys screenshots showing the missing SLA and job status for reference. I wanted to check in to understand:
- Why the job was placed on hold  
- Whether there are any upstream or dependency issues contributing to this  
- What the expected path/timing is to resume normal runs

This will help ensure we accurately document the issue and resolution for PARCM reporting.

Please let me know if there’s any additional information you need from my side.

Thanks,  
Kamran
