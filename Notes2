Hi Team,

Following up on Vedad’s note below — we need to stand up daily automated DQ summary emails by domain.

Scope / Domains
We will create one automated report per domain:
- Change  
- Records Management & Operations  
- Application  
- GT Reporting  

Each daily report must include (pass / fail counts):
- Upstream SLAs  
- Downstream SLAs  
- GVRs (upstream & downstream)  
- APIs  
- Null checks  
- Duplicate checks  

Next steps / asks:

1. Determine run timing per domain  
   - We need to analyze when all relevant controls complete for each domain.
   - The email should be sent shortly after final control completion to ensure accuracy.

2. Automation / Scheduling
   - We’ll partner with the Dev team to set this up as an Autosys job per domain.
   - Autosys should:
     - Trigger the data pull
     - Generate the report
     - Send the automated email on a daily cadence

3. Controls Team
   - Define the final report format/content
   - Validate timing assumptions per domain
   - Review initial outputs once automation is in place

Let’s use this week to:
- Confirm domain-specific completion times
- Align on report structure
- Get Autosys jobs created and scheduled

Once we have a proposed timing per domain, we can review quickly and move into implementation.

Thanks,  
Kamran

If you want, next I can:
- Turn this into Jira stories (analysis + automation + validation)
- Draft a standard report template the automation will generate
- Propose initial timing assumptions per domain based on what you already know

This is a solid ask from Vedad — and you’re framing it exactly the right way.
