I wanted to follow up on our recent conversations regarding the DQ/PARCM application migration and outline the items we need from your team in order to move forward with the Angular build.

As discussed, the Controls team is beginning the UI design and local Angular development so we can hit the ground running once the Dashboard module is created. To keep momentum and ensure alignment with TechADS standards, we need the following clarifications and assets from you and your team:

1. Controls Module Setup in Dashboard
	•	Confirmation that a new “controls” module will be created inside the Dashboard Angular codebase.
	•	Folder structure and naming conventions we should follow when building locally.
	•	Expected routing pattern for adding new pages under this module.

2. Repo Access & Development Workflow
	•	Access to the Dashboard Angular repo for read-only reference or (preferably) contribution.
	•	Guidance on the recommended branching strategy and CI/CD expectations.
	•	Clarification on how the Controls team should move stories through the Dashboard Dev board, since our current board will not allow code promotions.

3. Backend Service Layer Details
	•	Confirmation of how the Dashboard service layer (Spring Boot) will interact with Python scripts for evidence generation, Excel exports, PPT creation, and ORCIT processing.
	•	Any existing examples where Python is triggered from Dashboard that we can follow.

4. API Structure Expectations
	•	Whether the Daily DQ and PARCM UIs will call Java APIs that your team will expose, or whether Python entry points need to be wrapped within Java services.
	•	Expected response formats, error handling expectations, and naming conventions.

5. Upcoming Working Session
We’re preparing UI requirements, workflow diagrams, and cleaned-up enhancement documents. It would help if we could quickly align on the above items so that we can begin structuring the Angular app correctly from the start.

Please let me know if you’d like us to walk through the current Streamlit UI again or provide the documentation we’ve prepared ahead of time. We’re ready to adjust our meeting agenda based on what’s most helpful for you.

Thanks,
Kamran
