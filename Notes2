Got it 👍 — here’s a clean, ready-to-paste Jira comment you can add to the next story covering the DQ-002 documentation update and BT Converge removal. This mirrors the tone, structure, and level of detail from the prior closure comment so it’ll read consistent and audit-ready.

Jira Comment / Closure Update

This story is being closed following completion of the requested control metric documentation updates.

Summary of Work Completed
	•	Updated the DQ-002 calculation statement across all TechADS control metric documentation to clearly describe how provisioning success is measured, aggregated, and rolled up on a monthly basis.
	•	Ensured the DQ-002 methodology consistently reflects the current provisioning model, including SLA checks, payload/table loads, and downstream API consumption.
	•	Removed BT Converge from the Application domain asset list, as it is not currently in scope for DQ-002 measurement or reporting.
	•	Confirmed documentation alignment across all applicable domains:
	•	GT Reporting
	•	Record Management & Operations
	•	Application
	•	Change Management

These updates were completed to address governance feedback, ensure audit readiness, and align control documentation with the current TechADS data provisioning and monitoring process.

No further action is required for this item at this time.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Tighten this further for audit language (even more formal), or
	•	Reuse this as a standard closure template for future documentation stories so you don’t have to rewrite it each time.
