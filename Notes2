Hi Eric,

I wanted to give you a heads up on an upcoming database change that will impact the TechADS log views used by the Tableau dashboards.

As part of recent remediation work, the DOMAIN column in the TechADS SLA/log configuration tables is being renamed to TARGET_CATEGORY. This change applies across the underlying log views and supporting objects that feed reporting and dashboards.

Once this change is released, any Tableau logic, filters, or mappings that currently reference DOMAIN will need to be updated to reference TARGET_CATEGORY instead.

The change is tied to the TechADS Base remediation work (Jira: TADSBASE-7720) and is expected to be promoted shortly. I wanted to loop you in early so you have time to plan the necessary updates on the Tableau side and avoid any reporting disruptions.

Let me know if you’d like to review the impacted views together or if you need additional details from the dev team.

Thanks,
