Perfect — this one is a core BAU + audit-defensible story, so we’ll make it clean, reusable, and easy to explain on the Kanban call.

Below is the full Jira-ready output for TECHQARC-813, with a stronger title, tightened description, and clean Given / When / Then acceptance criteria.

Proposed Story Title

Maintain & Enhance Daily DQC SQL Logic for PARCM and EIQ Controls

(Reads clean to leadership + audit, and clearly frames this as ongoing ownership, not ad-hoc SQL.)

⸻

Description

This story covers ongoing analysis, maintenance, and enhancement of SQL logic used to support Daily Data Quality Controls (DQC) monitoring and PARCM reporting.

Work includes reviewing existing SQL queries, applying updates required for new or modified controls, supporting EIQ-driven control results, and troubleshooting daily control failures. Updates ensure accuracy of control results, proper failure detection, and alignment with upstream metadata, job execution behavior, and PARCM calculation requirements.

This effort supports reliable daily DQC operations and reduces downstream rework during monthly PARCM reporting.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria

Given Daily DQC monitoring relies on SQL logic to identify control failures and PARCM inputs
When SQL queries are reviewed and updated
Then queries accurately reflect current control logic and metadata definitions
And updates support correct identification of control pass/fail outcomes
And SQL changes are validated against recent control results and job execution behavior
And daily DQC outputs remain consistent, traceable, and suitable for PARCM reporting

⸻

Suggested Dates (Jira Fields Only)
	•	Start Date: January 15, 2026
	•	End Date: February 28, 2026

(Appropriate for iterative updates, validation, and ongoing troubleshooting.)

Optional Kanban Talking Point (for the sync)

“This is our BAU SQL maintenance story — it captures all daily DQC / PARCM SQL updates so we’re not creating one-off tickets every time logic changes.”

⸻

If you want, next we can:
	•	Normalize all remaining SQL / PARCM / RCA stories so they follow this same pattern
	•	Or prep one-liners for each story so you sound crisp and confident on the Kanban call
