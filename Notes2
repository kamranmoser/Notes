Hi all,

I wanted to follow up ahead of today’s scheduled call regarding ingesting EIQ data quality results into TechADS. I understand schedules may be tight today, so I wanted to clearly outline what we’re trying to accomplish and what we’re hoping to align on.

Context
- The Controls team is building a DQ / PARCM application within TechADS to support:
  - Daily DQ review and RCA
  - Analyst comments and Jira tracking
  - Monthly PARCM reporting
- For local TechADS DQ checks, the required tables, inserts, and triggers are currently being developed by the TechADS dev team.
- To fully support the app and PARCM reporting, we also need EIQ DQ results available within TechADS.

What we’re trying to achieve
- Ingest all relevant EIQ data quality results (failures + metadata) into TechADS-owned tables.
- Run this ingestion on a scheduled basis (daily / per run).
- Treat EIQ failures the same way as local DQ failures in the app:
  - Visible in the UI
  - Available for RCA and comments
  - Included in PARCM metrics and reporting

What we need to align on
- The best ingestion approach from EIQ → TechADS:
  - Scheduled job (e.g., Autosys pulling from EIQ)
  - Change-owned ingestion / distribute feed
  - Any existing ingestion framework we should leverage
- What failure-level data EIQ can provide for ingestion (IDs, check type, run info, timestamps, etc.).
- Ownership and setup:
  - Which team configures and owns the ingestion
  - Any access or service IDs required

If it’s easier, we’re happy to set up a short working session to walk through the DQ app, explain how the data will be used, and align on the best way to implement this ingestion.

Please let us know the best next step and who we should coordinate with to move this forward.

Thanks,  
Kamran
