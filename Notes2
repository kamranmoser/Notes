Hi Team,

I wanted to reach out regarding the scheduling of our EIQ control runs.

We typically schedule our EIQ runs once a year to cover the full calendar year through December 31. However, it looks like the runs were not scheduled out through December 31, 2026, and as a result, we currently do not have any EIQ controls running.

I wanted to check with your team first to see if this is something EIQ is able to help reschedule on your end. If so, please let me know the best way to proceed and any information you need from me.

If rescheduling needs to be handled on our side instead, could you please advise on the recommended process or steps to do this correctly? I want to make sure we re-enable the runs properly and avoid any gaps going forward.

Thanks in advance for your help, and please let me know how you’d like to proceed.

Best regards,  
Kamran
