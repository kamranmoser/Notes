Hi Team,

I wanted to reach out regarding the scheduling of our EIQ control runs.

We typically schedule our EIQ runs once a year to cover the full calendar year through December 31. However, it appears the runs were not scheduled out through December 31, 2026, and as a result, we currently do not have any EIQ controls running.

I’ve attached a spreadsheet with the full list of EIQ runs from the previous week, including the run IDs. Ideally, we would like to have those same run IDs scheduled through the remainder of the year using the same timing and frequency as before.

I wanted to check with your team first to see if this is something EIQ is able to assist with on your end. If so, please let me know the best way to proceed and whether there’s any additional information needed from me.

If the rescheduling needs to be handled on our side instead, could you please advise on the recommended process or steps to do this correctly? I want to ensure the runs are re-enabled properly and avoid any gaps going forward.

Thanks in advance for your help, and I appreciate your guidance on how best to proceed.

Best regards,  
Kamran
