Root Cause

What was the root cause of the metric breach? If an SLA was missed, for example, why was it missed?
	•	Three SLA failures occurred on 12/08/2025
	•	Two SLA failures were caused by password vaulting during a production CRQ, which delayed job execution timing
	•	Password rotation timing is dependent on CRQ execution and is outside the direct control of the DQC Controls team
	•	One SLA failure occurred due to a partition deletion logic issue
	•	Job failed while attempting to delete older partitions in the stage table
	•	No historical/older partitions were available to delete, resulting in job failure

Action Plan

What steps are being taken towards preventing this issue from occurring in the future?
	•	Partition deletion logic fix has been developed and is scheduled for deployment in the 01/29/2026 release
	•	SLA thresholds are being reassessed and updated to better account for CRQ-related password vaulting timing as part of the 01/29/2026 release
	•	Password vaulting-related delays have been documented as non-preventable timing_toggle events, and no additional technical remediation is required
