Hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out regarding our PARCM automation work and the upcoming integration with the ORCIT API. Our team is preparing to begin testing API submissions in the lower lanes, and we want to ensure we have all required information and validation steps from the ORCIT side.

To move forward, we are requesting your guidance on the following items:

1. Lower-Lane API Testing Setup
	•	Can you confirm the correct ORCIT Dev/UAT endpoints we should use for testing?
	•	Are there any restrictions around sending test payloads (e.g., dummy data, duplicate submissions, sample metrics)?
	•	Do we need to notify the ORCIT team before running test submissions?

2. API Payload Specifications
	•	Can you provide the expected JSON/XML structure for PARCM Key Measure Metric submissions?
	•	Are there specific required fields, codes, or domain identifiers that must be included?
	•	Any sample payloads or API documentation would be very helpful.

3. API Error Handling and Response Types
	•	What response formats should we expect for successful vs. failed submissions?
	•	Are there standard error codes or retry conditions we should account for in the integration?

4. Authentication Details
	•	We have successfully generated tokens using the SSO configuration.
	•	For PROD, we are working on the CIQ request—are there any ORCIT-specific fields we should be aware of for that setup?

5. Validation Requirements for Automation Approval
	•	Once we perform lower-lane test uploads, what evidence does ORCIT require to approve automation for Production?
	•	Is there a checklist or criteria that must be met?

Our goal is to fully automate PARCM metric submission from TechADS to ORCIT, and having your guidance on these points will help us design the API layer and begin end-to-end testing.

Please let me know if you prefer a quick call to walk through this—happy to accommodate.

Thanks in advance for your support,
