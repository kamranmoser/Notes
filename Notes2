Got it 👍 — here’s a revised close-out Jira comment that removes the UI references and clearly sets Autosys → PROD in March. This is clean, audit-safe, and aligned with what was actually communicated to Change.

You can paste this directly into the story and close it.

Closing Update / Final Status

This work is complete from the TechADS DQ Controls side.

Summary of outcomes:
	•	Alignment confirmed with Governance and Change on the approach to ingest EIQ Data Quality results into TechADS-owned tables
	•	Agreed that ingestion will be handled via scheduled Autosys jobs (daily run)
	•	Scope confirmed to ingest EIQ failure results and supporting metadata, treated consistently with existing TechADS DQ failures
	•	Results will be:
	•	Stored in TechADS-owned control tables
	•	Available for analyst review, RCA, and commentary
	•	Included in PARCM metrics and downstream reporting

Implementation details confirmed:
	•	Daily ingestion will load prior day (T-1) data
	•	Insert-based SQL scripts will be used to define source-to-target mappings
	•	Target table structures are defined and available in DEV
	•	Required artifacts (insert scripts) have been shared with the Change team to support Autosys job configuration

Delivery & promotion approach:
	•	Autosys job creation and promotion will be handled via the Change board
	•	Target Production timeline for Autosys ingestion: March
	•	UI-related work will be coordinated separately and is out of scope for this story

Next steps:
	•	Change team to proceed with Autosys job setup and promotion
	•	TechADS team to follow up separately on UI-related work

Closing this story as the ingestion approach, scope, and delivery plan have been finalized and handed off to Change for implementation.

If you want, I can also:
	•	Tighten this further for audit language
	•	Convert it into a “Resolved – Design Complete” style comment
	•	Or mirror the wording to match other closed TechADS architecture stories
