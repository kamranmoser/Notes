Subject: Quick Jira Sync | Meeting Notes & Next Steps

Team,

Here are the notes from our quick Jira stories call.

---

## Key Decisions

### 1) Legacy “Business Impact / MViews & APIs” story
- Reviewed the story that has been carried over for ~1–2 years.
- Agreed the story is too ambiguous and we’re also transitioning to the target state, so the effort isn’t worth prioritizing.
- Decision: Cancel/close the story.
- Action: Add a short justification in the Jira comments for why we’re cancelling.

## DQ App / Change Team Support (New Work)

### 2) EIQ → TechADS ingestion (Autosys job + tables)
- For the DQ App, we need an Autosys job to pull EIQ results into TechADS.
- There are 3 TechADS tables (create scripts exist; not in prod yet) that will receive the EIQ results.
- Change team asked for details so they can create the story and staff it with their developer, and move through UAT → SIT/SD as needed.

What I will send to Change team:
- Story summary + description + acceptance criteria
- Create scripts (for the 3 tables)
- Insert/load logic details (what to pull from EIQ, how to populate the tables)
- Any other relevant references/attachments

### 3) Moving UI/API work to Change board for production
- Current UI work is tracked on the Controls board.
- Once we’re ready to deploy to production, we’ll transition the required production items to the Change board (since that’s the path needed to promote/upgrade code).

### 4) Timing / planning
- Working assumption is targeting the March release.
- I will confirm with the team and share an updated timeline so Change can plan capacity and reserve space for the work.

## Action Items
- Kamran:  
  - Add justification comment and proceed with cancelling the legacy business impact story.  
  - Send Change team the story package for EIQ → TechADS ingestion (Autosys + tables): summary/AC + scripts + load details.  
  - Confirm target release timing (tentatively March) and share back.

- Change team:  
  - Create the story in the Change backlog and assign to a developer once details are received.  
  - Plan work into the March release window (pending final confirmation).

Thanks,  
Kamran
