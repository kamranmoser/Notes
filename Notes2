Hi Aswathy, Satya, and Lakshmi,

Hope you’re all doing well.

I’m reaching out to request your help with rescheduling a set of critical TechADS EIQ runs that we need in place to support the January PARCM reporting.

I’ve attached a spreadsheet that contains the full list of RUN IDs and their current status. Please note the following to avoid any confusion or duplicate scheduling:

- The attachment includes all RUN IDs that need to be reviewed.
- RUN IDs highlighted in green and marked as “Complete” in the Status column are already scheduled and do not require any action.
- RUN IDs marked with the comment “Scheduled by Controls” are the ones that still need to be scheduled and should be your primary focus.
- Before scheduling, please coordinate with each other to confirm which runs are already in place so we do not accidentally reschedule any jobs that are active. Duplicate scheduling could cause runs to execute multiple times per day, which we want to avoid.

These runs are critical for ensuring we have complete and accurate data for the January PARCM report. Please let me know if there are any questions, conflicts, or dependencies we should be aware of as you work through the list.

Thank you all for the support here — I really appreciate it.

Best regards,  
Kamran
