I support the TechADS Controls team by managing and maintaining data quality control metrics, including PARCM reporting, SLA tracking, and metric QA remediation. I partner closely with development, EIQ, and Governance teams to resolve control failures, document root causes, and ensure alignment between evidence, scheduling, and control metric documentation. I also drive process improvements and automation to strengthen control reliability and reporting accuracy.
