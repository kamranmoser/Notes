DQ-002 (Provisioning) is calculated from daily downstream provisioning controls and rolled up to a monthly result.
DQ-002 measures whether TechADS-provisioned data is made available correctly and on time for downstream consumption. The monthly DQ-002 percentage is derived by aggregating the daily control outcomes for the reporting month at the control level (pass / fail / total counts) and then rolling those results up to the DQ-002 metric level.

DQ-002 is driven by the following provisioning evidence types (as applicable by domain):
	•	Downstream SLA checks confirming target/provisioning jobs complete within defined SLA expectations
	•	Provisioning “payload / table-load” checks validating the expected target tables are successfully loaded and available for consumption
	•	Downstream consumption checks (e.g., API / distribute consumption) validating downstream consumers successfully retrieve (“pull”) the provisioned data when applicable

If a control miss is attributable to a planned platform outage (or other governance-approved exclusion), the miss is documented via RCA and excluded per the standard exclusion process so the final DQ-002 result reflects the adjusted, auditable outcome for the month.
