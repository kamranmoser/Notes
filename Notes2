JIRA Summary (Title)

Update Control Metric Documentation for DQ-002 and Application Asset Scope

⸻

Description

This story covers required documentation updates following alignment with the TechADS Governance team.

The control metric documentation was updated across all four TechADS domains to ensure accuracy, consistency, and audit readiness:
	•	Domains updated:
	•	GT Reporting
	•	Record Management & Operations
	•	Application
	•	Change Management
	•	A standardized DQ-002 calculation statement was added to each control metric document to clearly explain how provisioning success is measured, aggregated, and reported.
	•	The Application domain asset list was updated to remove BT Converge, as it is not yet in scope for DQ-002 measurement or reporting.

These updates ensure the control documentation accurately reflects the current provisioning model, downstream consumption patterns, and agreed-upon governance scope.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria (Given / When / Then)

Given the TechADS control metric documentation for GT Reporting, Record Management & Operations, Application, and Change Management,
When the documentation is reviewed for DQ-002 methodology and asset scope accuracy,
Then each document includes a consistent DQ-002 calculation statement describing how provisioning success is determined and rolled up monthly.

⸻

Given the Application domain control metric documentation and asset list,
When asset scope is validated against current onboarding and provisioning status,
Then BT Converge is removed from the Application domain asset list and no longer referenced as an in-scope asset.

⸻

Given the updated documentation,
When reviewed by governance or audit stakeholders,
Then the documents clearly reflect current DQ-002 calculation logic, approved exclusions, and accurate domain asset scope.

If you want, next we can:
	•	Add a linked follow-up story for future asset onboarding (BT Converge readiness)
	•	Break this into two stories (DQ-002 language vs. asset scope) if governance prefers separation
	•	Align the wording exactly with EDR / ORCIT language for zero rework later
