Hi Team,

Thank you for the discussion and follow-ups on the TechADS EIQ scheduling gap.

Attached is the unique list of RUN IDs from our prior executions. For these runs, please note:

- Confirmed parameters: The only parameter that varies across executions is the run date. No additional parameters are required.
- Scheduling intent: We are requesting that these RUN IDs be scheduled with the same timing and frequency as prior months for the remainder of the year.

In parallel, I want to share that Satya from the TechADS Controls team is currently scheduling a subset of high-priority recon runs that are required for critical reporting and near-term deliverables. This is to ensure coverage while the broader scheduling effort is addressed.

We can use tomorrow’s sync to:
- Confirm what has already been scheduled
- Identify any remaining RUN IDs that still need coverage
- Align on next steps for completing the full scheduling window

Please let me know if you need anything further from my side ahead of the meeting.

Thanks,  
Kamran
