Hello Team,

As part of our upcoming TechADS releases this week, Veda has requested that we complete both pre-release and post-release validation for the impacted stories.

Attached are the release lists for the three upcoming deployments:
- TADSGTDS – 01/29 (primary focus)
- TADSBASE – 01/30
- TADSCHANGE – 01/30

Priority:  
We’d like the team to focus on TADSGTDS first, given its reporting impact and earlier release date.

What we need from the team:
- Pre-release validation:  
  Please review the attached release lists and validate impacted controls, metrics, and dependencies in UAT prior to deployment.
- Post-release validation:  
  After each release, confirm expected behavior in PROD and validate that no new DQ or SLA issues are introduced.

We’ll also conduct a brief post-release review to capture any observations, issues, or follow-ups needed.

Please take some time to review the attached files and let me know if you see any concerns or areas that need additional attention ahead of the releases.

Thanks everyone for the support and partnership on this.

Best,  
Kamran  
TechADS Controls Team
