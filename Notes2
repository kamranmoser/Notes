Throughout 2025, I demonstrated a strong risk mindset by proactively identifying, managing, and remediating data quality and reporting risks across TechADS DQC processes. I ensured consistent adherence to EDM T-100 standards, transport policies, and governance expectations while supporting audit readiness and regulatory requirements.

I played a key role in producing and submitting monthly PARCM metrics for ORCIT, ensuring accuracy, completeness, and timely escalation of data quality issues. I actively investigated metric failures, partnered with TechADS, EIQ, EMP, and governance stakeholders to identify root causes, and supported remediation efforts to reduce recurring risk and improve control reliability.

I maintained clear documentation and process artifacts to support internal and external audits, including evidence related to DQ controls, metric calculations, and issue resolution. When risks or data inconsistencies were identified, I escalated appropriately, tracked resolution, and ensured alignment across teams before submission.

In addition, I contributed to strengthening the overall control environment by improving transparency into DQ failures, clarifying ownership, and supporting the onboarding and validation of new metrics. My approach consistently balanced delivery timelines with risk management expectations, helping ensure accurate reporting while minimizing operational and compliance risk.

Overall, my work supported sound risk management practices, improved audit readiness, and reinforced a culture of accountability and proactive risk identification within the TechADS DQC space.
