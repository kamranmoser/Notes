Hi Aswathy,

I’m handing off the remaining updates needed for the TechADS control metric document so we can align with the recent governance (Metric QA) discussion and close out the open items.

Below is a summary of what needs to be updated and why.

⸻

What needs to be updated

1. Target Asset Scope
	•	Please ensure the control metric document includes only one-hop provisioning assets, specifically:
	•	TechADS → RDR
	•	TechADS → Distribute
	•	Any assets downstream of Distribute should be removed, as they are out of scope for this control.

2. API Assets
	•	REST / API consumers should be listed in the control metric document.
	•	The document should clearly note that API consumers are dynamic and may change month to month due to onboarding, offboarding, and subscriber activity.
	•	The API consumer list should be treated as a point-in-time snapshot aligned to the reporting period and supporting evidence.

3. Alignment with Governance Statement
	•	The document should align with the agreed approach that:
	•	Target assets are recalculated monthly
	•	Evidence must align exactly with what is documented in the control metric
	•	SLAs apply to provisioned feeds, not APIs

⸻

Context / Why this matters

Governance is aligned with TechADS having dynamic downstream consumers, but they want the control metric document to:
	•	Clearly define what is in scope vs. out of scope
	•	Ensure the evidence matches what’s documented in the control metric
	•	Avoid ambiguity around APIs and downstream assets

Let me know if you want to review the changes together once you’ve made updates, or if anything above needs clarification before you start.

Thanks for taking this on — appreciate it.
