01/13/2026	2:00 PM – 2:30 PM	Sync on TechADS Dashboard Backend Setup for DQ Controls Module	Kamran Moser (Organizer) • Jayaprakash Kesavan (JK) • Jayaprabakar Subbaiyan (JS) • Shitanshu Thakur	Purpose of the meeting was to align on the backend integration approach for a new DQ Controls module within the TechADS Dashboard. • The DQ Controls team is building a new UI module to: • Display high-level DQ status (pass / fail / pending) • Show failure-level drilldowns • Display PARCM (monthly reporting) metrics • Frontend (Angular) setup is already in progress; backend connectivity is the current blocker. • Backend design guidance provided: • Use Spring Boot–based APIs consistent with existing TechADS architecture. • Prefer generic, parameter-driven APIs rather than creating separate APIs per table. • A single read endpoint can support multiple queries using parameters or object codes. • Write operations should be handled via JSON-driven POST APIs, routed to the appropriate tables. • DQ Controls data resides in a separate Controls schema, populated via automated jobs from the TechADS schema. • Controls team initially assumed they would build Spring Boot services; clarified that: • TechADS team will review and approve PRs • Code must comply with existing KDS / TechADS standards • Strong emphasis on environment discipline: • Development and testing must remain in Local / SIT • Avoid UAT and Production until explicitly approved • Kamran flagged difficulty running the backend locally due to unfamiliarity with Tomcat setup. • Agreement to conduct a 1:1 working session to walk through: • Starting and stopping Tomcat • Local backend execution • Build and deployment flow	Backend integration will follow existing TechADS API design patterns (generic read/write endpoints). • Controls team will not introduce new libraries or external dependencies in the UI. • All backend changes must go through TechADS code review and approval before promotion. • Initial development will remain in Local / SIT only.	Set up 1:1 working session to walk through local backend and Tomcat setup (Owner: Jayaprabakar Subbaiyan; Due: Not specified) • Provide examples of existing read/write API patterns used in TechADS (Owner: Jayaprabakar Subbaiyan / TechADS team; Due: Not specified) • Continue UI development while backend connectivity is being enabled (Owner: Kamran Moser; Due: Ongoing)	Schedule and complete the backend walkthrough session • Confirm whether existing APIs can be reused or if a dedicated endpoint is required • Align on promotion strategy once development stabilizes (SIT → later environments)	Not specified (1:1 follow-up to be scheduled offline)	This effort will be implemented as a sub-module within the TechADS Dashboard • Strong emphasis placed on avoiding changes that could impact existing tightly coupled modules • Production rollout is not time-critical; Controls schema data expected to reach production in the March–April timeframe • Governance expectation: all code changes must be reviewed, approved, and environment-safe
