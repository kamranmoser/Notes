btConverge is currently under Data Governance review and is not being considered as an in-scope source or target asset for Application Inventory metric calculations at this time. While btConverge may be registered in EMP, it does not participate directly in the one-hop data flows used for APPHQ DQ-001 and DQ-002 metric evaluation. As a result, btConverge is intentionally excluded from current Application Inventory metric reporting and will be reassessed once Governance finalizes its domain classification.
