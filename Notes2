Story Title

Provide Knowledge Transfer Sessions for DQC / PARCM Processes

⸻

Description

This story covers the planning and execution of structured knowledge transfer (KT) sessions for DQC and PARCM processes to onboard and upskill team members.

The sessions will focus on explaining end-to-end DQC daily controls monitoring, PARCM metrics, root cause analysis workflows, escalation processes, tooling (Jira, EIQ, EMP, Autosys, Tableau), and supporting governance expectations.

The goal is to ensure participants are confident in independently reviewing control failures, documenting analysis, escalating issues appropriately, and supporting monthly PARCM reporting activities.
