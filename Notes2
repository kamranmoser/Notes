Working Session – Nov 20, 2025

DQ/PARCM App – Discussion Summary (Copy & Paste Version)

Source:  ￼

⸻

1. Purpose of Today’s Session
	•	Align internally on next steps after yesterday’s TechADS Dev call.
	•	Discuss Confluence cleanup and documentation.
	•	Finalize strategy for the Angular migration.
	•	Clarify timeline concerns and TechADS dependencies.
	•	Decide how to begin Angular UI development locally while waiting on Dev.

⸻

2. Key Updates From Yesterday’s TechADS Dev Call (Reconfirmed Today)

A. Independent app is no longer possible
	•	Dev confirmed that creating a new standalone app or new server would require 1 year of approvals and funding.
	•	Therefore, the DQ/PARCM app must be hosted inside the existing TechADS Dashboard, not as an independent product.
	•	This contradicts the earlier vision for a separate Controls app.
(Confirmed by Tashu in transcript.)  ￼

B. Angular module must live inside Dashboard UI
	•	Sylvia’s team controls the Dashboard UI codebase.
	•	Controls team needs a module created inside Dashboard (similar to “enablement” module).
	•	All Controls Angular code must follow TechADS Dashboard’s folder structure.
	•	Controls cannot create their own independent Angular repo.

C. Controls cannot push code directly
	•	Because your board is an analytics/Jira board, not a development board:
	•	You cannot move stories through Dev → Testing → Ready for Prod.
	•	The commit hooks will fail.
	•	Dev must:
	•	Create Jira stories for your work on their board
	•	OR add the Controls team to the Dashboard Dev board.

D. You are locked into TechADS release cycles
	•	Controls cannot deploy independently.
	•	Every UI update depends on Dashboard’s release schedule.
	•	This will slow down timelines significantly.
(You voiced concern about being bound by their cycles.)  ￼

E. Python backend discussion
	•	Sylvia originally said Python backend might not be allowed.
	•	Namrata said Python backend can be supported.
	•	After explanation, Namrata understood that TechADS already runs Python scripts behind Dashboard in other modules.
	•	Dev will need to confirm the pattern for:
	•	Where Python scripts live
	•	How UI triggers them
	•	How to wire them into Dashboard APIs

F. TechADS Dev still owes Controls:
	1.	The module structure for Controls inside Dashboard
	2.	Repo access
	3.	Guidance on Python execution model
	4.	Confirmation on Angular + backend approach

3. Internal Strategy Alignment (Controls Team)

A. Build Angular Locally FIRST (without waiting for Dev)
	•	Because TechADS Dev moves slowly, Controls team decided:
	•	Start building the entire UI in Angular locally
	•	Follow the same structure as Dashboard’s Angular code
	•	Build it in a “controls” module folder
	•	Once Dev creates the official module, simply copy/paste the working Angular folder into Dashboard UI repo

This avoids sitting idle waiting for Dev’s module creation.

B. Local Build Strategy
	•	Follow the existing Dashboard repo structure:
	•	Source
	•	App
	•	Modules
	•	Enablement module (as reference)
	•	Build your own “controls” module with:
	•	DQ page
	•	PARCM page
	•	Evidence pages
	•	API placeholders
	•	Then, later, merge with Dashboard.

C. Kamran to be involved in Angular learning
	•	You asked to be included in Angular development sessions.
	•	You will attend sessions to understand UI structuring and participate in building Components/Pages.

D. Confluence updates
	•	You updated links, tracker, architecture diagrams, and enhancements list.
	•	The goal is to have one place where the whole team is aligned.

⸻

4. Timeline Expectations
	•	Real work won’t start until January due to:
	•	December release freezes
	•	Holidays
	•	Dev team’s slow response rate
	•	Angular development will take multiple months.
	•	Controls agreed internally:
	•	A realistic timeline for complete SIT + UAT + PROD readiness is May 2026 or later.
(You stated you already pushed expectations to May.)

⸻

5. Governance & RMO Side Discussion (Not Project Work, but Relevant)
	•	Kamran has been handling governance questions around RMO failures.
	•	RCA and action plans require more clarity.
	•	Plan to involve Sridhar (offshore) in DQ process training.
(This is separate from PARCM app but increases workload.)

⸻

6. Action Items (Controls Team)

For Controls Team
	•	Continue enriching Confluence – make it the source of truth.
	•	Begin local Angular build next week or when Kamran returns.
	•	Follow TechADS Dashboard module structure.
	•	Include Sridhar in future morning syncs for Angular development.
	•	Prepare questions for Dev:
	•	“Provide module structure and repo access”
	•	“Confirm Python hosting pattern”
	•	“Assign us to Dev Jira board”
	•	Prepare a follow-up email to Sylvia + Namrata summarizing what Controls needs.

Future Work
	•	Build Angular UI locally:
	•	Replicate Dashboard structure
	•	Controls module
	•	Pages and components
	•	When Dev responds, merge local work inside Dashboard repo.

7. What Controls Needs from TechADS Dev (Still Outstanding)
	1.	Module Creation
The official “controls” module inside Dashboard.
	2.	Repo Access
Code permissions to the Angular UI repo.
	3.	How Python Will Run
Confirmation on:
	•	pattern
	•	folder
	•	triggers
	•	API integration
	4.	JIRA Access
Either:
	•	Create Dev stories for Controls
	•	OR allow Controls to use Dev board statuses for commit hooks.
	5.	Timeline for Their Deliverables
They asked “When do you need it?”
Controls clarified you need module structure immediately to start.

8. Updated Overall Status (After Nov 20 Session)

Current Status
	•	Streamlit MVP works for Daily DQ + PARCM.
	•	Controls schema partially done.
	•	Autosys not started.
	•	ORCIT work pending SSO CIQ.
	•	Angular migration blocked by TechADS Dev, but Controls will begin Angular locally.

Major Dependencies
	•	Dashboard module creation
	•	Repo access
	•	Dev confirmation on Python backend
	•	API structure
	•	CI/CD details

Key Risks
	•	Being forced to follow Dashboard release cycle
	•	Dev team slow responsiveness
	•	Lack of upfront technical clarity
	•	Two-step integration:
(1) build locally → (2) merge into Dashboard
