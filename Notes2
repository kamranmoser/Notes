Hi Team,

Following up on the GT Reporting SLA failures from December 8, 2025, I’ve updated the attached spreadsheet to make it easier to capture the details Governance is requesting.

I’ve added the following columns at the end of each failed record:
- Root Cause  
- Source of the Issue (Upstream vs. TechADS)  
- Short-Term Fix  
- Long-Term / Prevention Plan  
- Failure Status  
- TechADS Jira Story (if applicable)

Request:  
Please review the rows relevant to your area and fill out the new columns directly in the spreadsheet, then send the updated file back to me.

This information will be used to respond to Governance (Jeff) and to support leadership reporting, so concise but clear explanations are appreciated.

If any item requires discussion or coordination across teams, feel free to note that in the comments or flag it to me separately.

Thanks for the quick turnaround on this.

Best,  
Kamran
