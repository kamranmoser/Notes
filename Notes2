Subject: Daily Controls Monitoring KT – Part 2 | Meeting Notes & Next Steps

Team,

Here are the meeting notes from Daily Controls Monitoring KT – Part 2 (Hands-On Failure Review).

---

## Purpose of Session
- Part 2 was hands-on, focused on building confidence to:
  - Review daily control failures
  - Document RCA consistently
  - Know when/how to escalate
  - Track recurring issues through Jira so they actually get fixed

## Key Reminders / Why This Matters
- Daily DQC monitoring is the source of truth for:
  - Data timeliness
  - Data completeness
  - Data quality
- Daily outcomes feed directly into PARCM (PARCM becomes mechanical if daily monitoring/RCA is done correctly).

## Access / Setup
- Confirmed the key access areas needed for day-to-day work (DB, Jira, eIQ, EMP, Tableau, Autosys).
- Shared drive setup:
  - A working failure list was posted in the shared drive (everyone should save a local copy to work off).
  - Created individual folders for sharing artifacts/materials during KT sessions.

---

## Standard Workflow (Mental Model)
We will follow the same loop for every failure:
Detect → Understand → Document → Escalate → Track

What each step means:
- Detect: Identify failures (daily report/app/spreadsheet output).
- Understand: Use logs + email history + patterns to determine “what happened.”
- Document: Add clear failure comments and RCA notes in the tracker.
- Escalate: Notify the owning team (TechADS vs upstream vs downstream).
- Track: Ensure recurring items are tracked via Jira and followed up until fixed.

## Hands-On Walkthrough (SLA Examples)
We focused on SLAs since they typically take the most time and analysis effort.

### Example 1 – “Missing SLA” due to decommissioned job still in config
- Used DYNAMIC_LOG_VIEW to validate job execution history:
  - Filtered using EXECUTION_ORDER = 0 to view the overall job (not every step).
  - Confirmed last successful/failed runs and whether the job stopped running.
- Checked email history to confirm the job was placed on hold / decommissioned due to upstream/source no longer sending data (0 files/records).
- Key point: even if the job is decommissioned, it will continue to show as Missing SLA as long as it remains active in SLA_CONFIG.
- Action:
  - Escalate to dev team to create a Jira story to remove the SLA entry from SLA_CONFIG (and/or fully decommission related entries).
  - Track as Unresolved until config is updated.

### Example 2 – SLA misses caused by predecessor runtime creeping
- Observed start time shifting later and runtime variability.
- Checked Autosys to identify:
  - Predecessor job behavior (runtime spikes)
  - Whether upstream/predecessor jobs are delaying successor and causing SLA misses
- Action:
  - Email dev team to investigate:
    - Performance regression / runtime variability
    - Whether SLA adjustment is appropriate (ex: +30 minutes) vs fixing underlying performance

### Follow-up expectations
- For PARCM in-scope domains/issues, follow up every 24–48 hours if still failing or if no response.
- Once a Jira story is created and prioritized, follow-ups shift to ensuring it stays moving to release.
- Recurring issues should also be brought up in the weekly TechADS Controls + Dev sync to accelerate progress.

---

## Quick Guidance on Other Control Types (High Level)
- GVR: Counts should match → usually escalate directly to dev team, request RCA and remediation.
- Nulls/Dupes: Validate against EMP/metadata first:
  - If metadata is correct, escalate to remediate data (ETL/source).
  - If metadata changed/incorrect, work with metadata team to update indicators/remove check.
- Deviations: Confirm whether the record count is valid; if valid, request an override as needed and document rationale.

---

## Next Sessions / Next Steps
- Schedule follow-up KT for:
  - End-to-end practice: run the app → export file → analyze → document → escalate
  - eIQ walkthrough (viewing failures and pulling details)
  - Tableau dashboard interpretation
- Longer-term: start ramping into monthly PARCM compilation, once daily monitoring/RCA is consistent.
- Automation / future-state updates:
  - Work is underway to move this workflow into a TechADS dashboard module and reduce spreadsheet dependence (failures + comments stored in DB).

---

## Action Items
- Sridharshar: Work toward running the app end-to-end (app → spreadsheet → analysis) in the next session; continue access setup as needed.
- Amruta: Continue getting app setup on machine (in progress) and begin practicing failure review using the shared tracker.
- All: Use the tracker consistently for failure comments, ownership, and escalation notes; flag recurring issues for Jira creation.

Thanks,
