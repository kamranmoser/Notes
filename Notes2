Story Title

GT Reporting – Root Cause Analysis for Recent Control Failures

⸻

Description

This story covers the analysis and documentation of recent daily data quality control failures for the GT Reporting domain.

The work includes reviewing failed controls, analyzing upstream and downstream dependencies, identifying the root cause of each failure, determining ownership (TechADS, upstream source, or downstream consumer), and coordinating with relevant teams for remediation or confirmation.

All findings will be documented to support daily controls monitoring, PARCM metric accuracy, and governance reporting requirements.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria

Given GT Reporting daily control execution results are available
When recent control failures are reviewed and analyzed
Then each failure has a clearly documented root cause
And ownership is identified and recorded (upstream, downstream, or TechADS)
And required escalations or follow-ups are initiated and tracked
And documentation supports PARCM metrics and governance reporting needs
