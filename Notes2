Hi Subashis,

Now that Amit and the EIQ team are aligned on the approach, I wanted to check on next steps to get this into execution.

Can you let me know:
	•	What the process is to get the required Change Dev stories created
	•	Whether your team would prefer to create the stories, or if you’d like us to draft them
	•	How this work would get scheduled into an upcoming release once the stories are in place

I’ve shared the SQL/scripts for the daily EIQ → TechADS ingestion and can walk through them if helpful.

Thanks,
Kamran
