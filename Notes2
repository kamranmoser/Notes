Following up on our recent Metric QA discussions, we have updated the Control Metric documentation to address the gaps and clarifications identified during the review.

Summary of updates included:
	•	Updated source asset listings for the Change Domain to align with one-hop upstream scope.
	•	Added a consolidated PPRT_MVIEW explanatory note clarifying how upstream Change sources are aggregated and represented in source metric calculations.
	•	Explicitly documented exceptions (e.g., Alteryx) where applicable.
	•	Added clarifying comments for Application Inventory (APPHQ) regarding btConverge, which remains under Governance review.
	•	Incorporated supporting design diagrams from data owners to reinforce metric attribution and lineage.
