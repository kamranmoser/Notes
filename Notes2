Hi Amruta and Sridarshan,

Ahead of our KT session tomorrow, I wanted to share a high-level agenda so you know what to expect.

KT Session Agenda (High-Level):
- Overview of the TechADS DQ Controls Team Hub and key documentation
- Purpose and scope of the Daily DQC monitoring process
- Walkthrough of the Daily DQC Guide
  - Key control types monitored (SLA, GVR, Null/Duplicate, Deviation, etc.)
  - End-to-end daily monitoring workflow
- Tools and resources used for daily monitoring
  - EIQ, Autosys, Tableau, logs, and trackers
- High-level RCA and escalation approach
  - Identifying root cause
  - Determining ownership (upstream vs TechADS)
  - Tracking remediation
- How Daily DQC ties into PARCM, control metric documents, and reporting
- Next steps and follow-up KT sessions (deeper dives as needed)

This session will be focused on providing a shared foundation and walkthrough. We’ll plan additional sessions to go deeper into hands-on monitoring, RCA examples, and PARCM submissions.

Looking forward to walking through this together.

Thanks,  
Kamran
