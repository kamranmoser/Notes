Purpose of Meeting
	•	Review the current DQ Streamlit app functionality and architecture
	•	Discuss transition to an Angular + Spring Boot framework
	•	Understand hosting options within TechADS
	•	Identify technical requirements for deployment, CI/CD, and SSO/security

⸻

Key Discussion Points
	•	Streamlit cannot be hosted in production environments
	•	Angular migration is required for long-term hosting and support
	•	Dev team is considering embedding the new Angular UI within the existing “Dashboard” app
	•	Dev team needs a full demo of both Streamlit apps before confirming hosting
	•	Controls team will need to provide functional details, architecture, and failure workflows

⸻

Current App Model (Streamlit)

DDQ App (Daily Failures)
	•	Reads failure logs from TechADS schema
	•	Extracts failures, loads into UI, allows editing, exporting, and reviewing root cause comments
	•	Local Task Scheduler sends automated emails when failure comments are missing
	•	Limitations:
	•	No persistence layer
	•	Long load times
	•	Local dependency (non-production)

PARCM App (Monthly Analysis)
	•	Users review all control failures for the month
	•	Edit columns, add comments, and export reports
	•	Generates automated PowerPoint reporting
	•	Calculates OrcIT Key Measure metrics
	•	Limitations:
	•	Requires unified environment
	•	Manual controls schema missing in TechADS today

⸻

Future Architecture Notes
	•	AutoSys will replace the local Task Scheduler for job automation
	•	Failures will be loaded into the new Controls schema
	•	Unified Angular UI will support BOTH DDQ + PARCM functionality
	•	Application will enable:
	•	Viewing failures
	•	Editing and updating RCA comments
	•	Export to Excel
	•	Automated PPT generation
	•	OrcIT API metric submission

⸻

Dev Team Requests
	•	Full demo of DDQ and PARCM Streamlit apps
	•	Bitbucket repo containing all current Streamlit code
	•	Functional requirements document / enhancement list
	•	Architecture slides summarizing app flow and dependencies
	•	Clarification on:
	•	User roles
	•	Expected features in Angular
	•	UI workflow for DDQ + PARCM

⸻

Action Items — Controls Team
	•	Send all slides to Dev team ✔️
	•	Schedule Streamlit demo for Dev team
	•	Share Bitbucket repo access
	•	Prepare combined walkthrough of DDQ + PARCM features
	•	Finalize Controls Schema tables (SLA_DQ, GVR_DQ, PARCM tables)
	•	Prepare detail on user roles and access permissions

⸻

Action Items — TechADS Dev Team
	•	Review slides and functional list
	•	Confirm whether Angular UI will be hosted in Dashboard or as a standalone app
	•	Provide Angular hosting requirements:
	•	Repo creation
	•	CI/CD pipeline
	•	Lower lane environment setup
	•	Build and deployment steps
	•	Provide SSO + OAuth + security integration guidance
	•	Review new schema structures after Controls team finalizes them

⸻

Next Steps
	1.	Conduct live Streamlit demo with the Dev team
	2.	Dev team provides hosting decision (Dashboard vs standalone)
	3.	Dev provides Angular environment + repo setup instructions
	4.	Controls team finalizes schema and starts prepping for Angular build
	5.	Start drafting Angular UI screens and component design
	6.	Begin CI/CD onboarding once Dev provides framework

⸻

Project Status Summary
	•	Architecture is defined and documented
	•	Streamlit cannot move to production → Angular is the confirmed long-term direction
	•	Dev team is aligned but needs a demo to finalize hosting approach
	•	Once hosting and CI/CD requirements are defined, Angular development can begin
